## 10/19/2025 12 PM - Setup Project created and banner  project added repo link   

Today I finally started working on my **Smart Plant Watering & Monitoring System** project in Hack Club Blueprint. I spent a good amount of time just setting everything up and thinking about how I want the project to look and work. First, I added the project title and wrote a detailed description explaining what my project does and why it’s useful. I made sure to explain that it will automatically water plants when the soil is dry, monitor soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, display all the information on a 16x2 LCD, and connect to a mobile app for remote monitoring. I tried to make the description clear so anyone reading it would understand what I’m building, even if they don’t know much about electronics.

Next, I created a GitHub repository for the project. I wasn’t sure at first how this worked on my phone, but I managed to create the repo, give it a name, and copy the HTTPS link. I added this link in the Blueprint “Repo link” section. Even though I haven’t uploaded the code yet, it feels good to have the repository ready. This way, I can add my Arduino code, wiring diagrams, and screenshots later as I make progress.

I also uploaded a banner image I found online for IoT smart plant watering systems. It looks clean and makes my project page visually appealing. I think having a nice banner will help reviewers understand my project at a glance.

After that, I spent some time planning how I will connect all the components: ESP32, soil moisture sensor, DHT sensor, relay, 16x2 LCD, and the water pump. I thought about which pins I will use and how the sensors will communicate with the microcontroller. I also considered how to display the readings on the LCD and send the data to the mobile app. I didn’t draw a full circuit diagram yet because I’m only on my phone, but I have a clear idea in my head of how it will all come together.

Overall, this was my first real step in building the project. I spent around 2 hours today setting everything up, and it feels really good to have the project started. I’m excited to move forward, write the Arduino code, test it in a simulation, and eventually build the actual system. This is the beginning of my journey documenting the project in Hack Club Blueprint, and I’m motivated to keep updating the journal as I make progress.![IoT-Smart-Plant-Watering-System-Project.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzI0NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--62712c0292c9ac079c8e7ccb202905d7f9f1e338/IoT-Smart-Plant-Watering-System-Project.jpg)
  

## 10/19/2025 10 PM - Circuit designing   

Today I finally started working on my Smart Plant Watering and Monitoring System project in Hack Club Blueprint I spent like 2 hours just setting up stuff and thinking how I want everything to look and work First I added the project name and wrote a simple description about what my project does and why it’s useful I said it will water plants by itself when the soil gets dry and it will also check soil moisture temperature and humidity and show all that on a 16x2 LCD It will also connect to a mobile app so we can see everything from our phone I tried to write it in a way that anyone can understand even if they don’t know much about electronics

Then I made a GitHub repo for it I didn’t really know how to do it on phone but after trying few times I finally made it I gave it a name and copied the link and added it in the repo section in Blueprint I haven’t uploaded my code yet but it still feels nice that I got the repo ready Now I can put my Arduino code and circuit pics later when I start doing more things

I also added a banner photo I found online It was about IoT plant watering and it looks really nice It makes my project page look better and I think when people see it they will quickly understand what my project is about

After that I was thinking how to connect all the parts like ESP32 soil sensor DHT sensor relay LCD and the water pump I was planning which pins I will use and how the sensors will send data to ESP32 and how I will show it on LCD and mobile app I didn’t make the circuit diagram yet because I’m on phone but I can already imagine it in my head

So yeah this was my first real step in this project It feels so good to finally start it I’m really excited to write the code test it out and then make the real system I’ll keep updating my journal as I go This is just the beginning but I’m super motivated right now

## 10/20/2025 1 AM - Preparing BOM  

Today I worked on making the list of components for my Smart Plant Watering & Monitoring System. I selected ESP32 as main controller, DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity, soil moisture sensor, 16x2 LCD, relay, water pump, tubing, breadboard with jumper wires, USB cable, plastic boxes and a power bank. I also decided how many of each I need and estimated total cost.

While doing this I faced some problems. First, it was confusing to choose which ESP32 module to buy because there are many types and I was not sure which one is best for my project. Then I had trouble checking compatibility of sensors and relay with ESP32. I also wanted to keep the cost reasonable but some items were expensive or sold in packs, so I had to calculate carefully how many I need. Choosing the plastic boxes and tubing was tricky too because I had to make sure water will not leak and electronics stay safe.

I added Amazon links for all components and will include screenshots of important products in the journal. This really helped me understand why each component is needed and how all will work together in final project. Even though it was little hard, it was fun to plan everything and think how the actual hardware will be connected later.![Screenshot_2025-10-19-22-17-20-813_com.android.chrome.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzUwOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e57024b2492987bc68acc6f867f1a2c9dcbc941f/Screenshot_2025-10-19-22-17-20-813_com.android.chrome.jpg)![Screenshot_2025-10-19-22-15-00-787_com.android.chrome.jpg](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzUxMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5489c440c34e44176cd376e1836271d7dcb76a1e/Screenshot_2025-10-19-22-15-00-787_com.android.chrome.jpg)

## 10/20/2025 9 AM - Workflow Planning  

Today I made a small plan about how my Smart Plant Watering & Monitoring System will work in real life. The ESP32 will read soil moisture data, and when the value is below a certain level, it will turn on the relay to start the water pump. After some time, when soil becomes wet, the ESP32 will turn off the pump again. The DHT11 sensor will send temperature and humidity values to Blynk app through WiFi. On the LCD display, all readings like “Soil Moisture: xx%”, “Temp: xx°C”, and “Humidity: xx%” will show together.

In the next steps, I want to connect everything physically and test how it works. I also plan to make the code better by adding LED indicators and maybe a buzzer alert when the soil is too dry. For now, I have only simulated the sensors and wiring, but once I get all components, I will do the real testing. This project taught me how IoT systems actually communicate and how automation can make daily life easier.![file_0000000063786209ac14e1f0083f3644.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzY2NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9b9f0bbebd9e958f6f38caba9ecc95e432b225f7/file_0000000063786209ac14e1f0083f3644.png)
  

## 10/21/2025 - Code planing  

Today I started working on the code for my Smart Plant Watering & Monitoring System. I wrote the basic structure in Arduino IDE on my phone using an online compiler. My main goal was to plan how each part of the project will work together — like reading the soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data, and turning the relay ON when the soil becomes dry.

At first, I wrote simple code to read values from the soil moisture sensor using the analog pin. Then I added DHT11 sensor code to measure temperature and humidity. I also planned how the LCD will show all three readings together. I didn’t connect the actual components yet, but I tested the logic part to see if it compiles properly.

While coding, I faced some small problems like missing libraries and errors with the LCD and DHT sensor libraries. I had to search online to find the correct ones and understand how to include them properly. I also got a bit confused between analog and digital pins for the sensors, but after some tries I understood how ESP32 handles them.

I also planned how to later connect this with the Blynk app for real-time monitoring. I learned about Blynk tokens and how to send data to the cloud using Wi-Fi. It was quite fun to imagine how everything will work together even before building it. I spent around 2 hours today planning and writing the code, and now I feel more confident that my logic is correct for when I get the components.

## 10/22/2025 - Power bank change and tried to make 3d model  

Today I changed my powerbank. The old one was too costly so I found a new one which is cheaper but works good also. The new one cost ₹849 and will power my ESP32, sensors and pumps easily. Here is the link https://amzn.in/d/jcUfgKE.

Also I wanted to share that I’m doing this full project only on my mobile phone (4GB RAM) because I don’t have a laptop. I belong to a middle class family and we can’t afford laptop right now but I really love doing electronic and coding things. So I’m trying my best to learn and build this from what I have.

I even tried to make a 3D model for my project using Prisma 3D app in phone but it was so hard to make it properly on small screen. I’ll still keep trying to make something simple.

I’m just very excited to finish this project soon. I really want to learn more things like IoT and automation. Thanks to Hack Club for giving this kind of chance to students like me 🙏❤️![Screenshot_2025-10-22-07-34-44-478_in.amazon.mShop.android.shopping.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDI2NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--edc225b6116d3bb5b72bc6d0b431ff9d3b067582/Screenshot_2025-10-22-07-34-44-478_in.amazon.mShop.android.shopping.jpg)
  

## 10/30/2025 - SOME CHANGES  

1. hey guys, so i just made some new updates in my project after @Kai Pereira told me about few changes. first thing, i changed my whole readme and wrote everything by myself this time without using any ai or help. it took me some time to think and write it in my own words but i did it finally. i also added a plastic box as a cover for my components, so all parts like esp32, sensors, lcd etc can stay safe and fixed in one place. it also makes the project look more clean and proper. i used whatever i had at home and tried my best to make it look neat. i don’t have a laptop or big setup, i’m doing all this just on my 4gb ram phone and still trying to make everything work good. i even tried to make a 3d model on prisma 3d but it was really hard on mobile so i used a real plastic box instead. i’m enjoying learning all this slowly and it feels really good to build something on my own. i hope now my project gets approved and i can keep improving it more later![Screenshot_2025-10-30-19-24-35-884_in.amazon.mShop.android.shopping](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjcyMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6b6372bd686021a9b68f1292d00e44958be35865/Screenshot_2025-10-30-19-24-35-884_in.amazon.mShop.android.shopping.jpg)
  

## 10/31/2025 - Case  

 I got a new plastic case from Amazon for ₹699 — https://amzn.in/d/9KpNJyE. This one is not for the project setup but for keeping all my electronic components safe and organized.

Earlier I was using a small plastic box to hold the ESP32, relay, LCD, and sensors in my project itself. That box still works great for the Smart Plant Watering System. But now, since I started collecting more parts like jumper wires, sensors, and other small stuff, I needed a proper place to keep them all together so they don’t get lost or damaged.

This new case has separate slots, so it’s easy to find components when I’m building or fixing something. It really helps me stay organized, especially since I’m doing everything from my phone and don’t have a laptop yet.

So yeah, this update is just to show that I got a proper case for storing my electronic parts safely, while my project setup is still in the plastic box I made earlier!
