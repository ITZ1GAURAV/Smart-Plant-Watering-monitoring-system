This is my journal of the design and building process of **Smart Plant Watering & Monitoring System**.

## 10/19/2025 - Setup Project created and banner  project added repo link   

Today I finally started working on my **Smart Plant Watering & Monitoring System** project in Hack Club Blueprint. I spent a good amount of time just setting everything up and thinking about how I want the project to look and work. First, I added the project title and wrote a detailed description explaining what my project does and why it’s useful. I made sure to explain that it will automatically water plants when the soil is dry, monitor soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, display all the information on a 16x2 LCD, and connect to a mobile app for remote monitoring. I tried to make the description clear so anyone reading it would understand what I’m building, even if they don’t know much about electronics.

Next, I created a GitHub repository for the project. I wasn’t sure at first how this worked on my phone, but I managed to create the repo, give it a name, and copy the HTTPS link. I added this link in the Blueprint “Repo link” section. Even though I haven’t uploaded the code yet, it feels good to have the repository ready. This way, I can add my Arduino code, wiring diagrams, and screenshots later as I make progress.

I also uploaded a banner image I found online for IoT smart plant watering systems. It looks clean and makes my project page visually appealing. I think having a nice banner will help reviewers understand my project at a glance.

After that, I spent some time planning how I will connect all the components: ESP32, soil moisture sensor, DHT sensor, relay, 16x2 LCD, and the water pump. I thought about which pins I will use and how the sensors will communicate with the microcontroller. I also considered how to display the readings on the LCD and send the data to the mobile app. I didn’t draw a full circuit diagram yet because I’m only on my phone, but I have a clear idea in my head of how it will all come together.

Overall, this was my first real step in building the project. I spent around 2 hours today setting everything up, and it feels really good to have the project started. I’m excited to move forward, write the Arduino code, test it in a simulation, and eventually build the actual system. This is the beginning of my journey documenting the project in Hack Club Blueprint, and I’m motivated to keep updating the journal as I make progress.![IoT-Smart-Plant-Watering-System-Project.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzI0NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--62712c0292c9ac079c8e7ccb202905d7f9f1e338/IoT-Smart-Plant-Watering-System-Project.jpg)
