## 10/19/2025 12 PM - Setup Project created and banner  project added repo link   

Today I finally started working on my **Smart Plant Watering & Monitoring System** project in Hack Club Blueprint. I spent a good amount of time just setting everything up and thinking about how I want the project to look and work. First, I added the project title and wrote a detailed description explaining what my project does and why it’s useful. I made sure to explain that it will automatically water plants when the soil is dry, monitor soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, display all the information on a 16x2 LCD, and connect to a mobile app for remote monitoring. I tried to make the description clear so anyone reading it would understand what I’m building, even if they don’t know much about electronics.

Next, I created a GitHub repository for the project. I wasn’t sure at first how this worked on my phone, but I managed to create the repo, give it a name, and copy the HTTPS link. I added this link in the Blueprint “Repo link” section. Even though I haven’t uploaded the code yet, it feels good to have the repository ready. This way, I can add my Arduino code, wiring diagrams, and screenshots later as I make progress.

I also uploaded a banner image I found online for IoT smart plant watering systems. It looks clean and makes my project page visually appealing. I think having a nice banner will help reviewers understand my project at a glance.

After that, I spent some time planning how I will connect all the components: ESP32, soil moisture sensor, DHT sensor, relay, 16x2 LCD, and the water pump. I thought about which pins I will use and how the sensors will communicate with the microcontroller. I also considered how to display the readings on the LCD and send the data to the mobile app. I didn’t draw a full circuit diagram yet because I’m only on my phone, but I have a clear idea in my head of how it will all come together.

Overall, this was my first real step in building the project. I spent around 2 hours today setting everything up, and it feels really good to have the project started. I’m excited to move forward, write the Arduino code, test it in a simulation, and eventually build the actual system. This is the beginning of my journey documenting the project in Hack Club Blueprint, and I’m motivated to keep updating the journal as I make progress.![IoT-Smart-Plant-Watering-System-Project.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzI0NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--62712c0292c9ac079c8e7ccb202905d7f9f1e338/IoT-Smart-Plant-Watering-System-Project.jpg)
  

## 10/19/2025 10 PM - Circuit designing   

Today I started planning the circuit of my Smart Plant Watering & Monitoring System. I added ESP32, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, soil moisture sensor and 16x2 LCD display. I also planned that water pump will be connected to relay and ESP32 will turn it on when soil is dry.

While making the circuit i faced many problems. First, connecting all the sensors and lcd was little confusing because i was not sure about which pins to use. I also wanted to add water pump with relay, but there are not enough pins in ESP32 to connect everything in Circuito. It was little frustrating because i couldnt connect pump and relay like in real project.

Even though i couldnt fully connect pump, i learned a lot about how ESP32 reads sensor values, how relay works, and how lcd can display temperature, humidity and soil moisture. I also understood pin limitations and how to organize connections properly.

I took screenshots of the circuit layout and wrote all my code in Circuito for sensors and lcd. In the code i explained how pump will work when soil is dry. Later, when i get all components physically, i will assemble full project and test everything.

It was little hard but also very interesting to plan the circuit and think how every component will work together. I also realized that sometimes virtual tools have limitations, but it helped me understand how the real hardware connections will be.

## 10/20/2025 - Preparing BOM  

Today I worked on making the list of components for my Smart Plant Watering & Monitoring System. I selected ESP32 as main controller, DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity, soil moisture sensor, 16x2 LCD, relay, water pump, tubing, breadboard with jumper wires, USB cable, plastic boxes and a power bank. I also decided how many of each I need and estimated total cost.

While doing this I faced some problems. First, it was confusing to choose which ESP32 module to buy because there are many types and I was not sure which one is best for my project. Then I had trouble checking compatibility of sensors and relay with ESP32. I also wanted to keep the cost reasonable but some items were expensive or sold in packs, so I had to calculate carefully how many I need. Choosing the plastic boxes and tubing was tricky too because I had to make sure water will not leak and electronics stay safe.

I added Amazon links for all components and will include screenshots of important products in the journal. This really helped me understand why each component is needed and how all will work together in final project. Even though it was little hard, it was fun to plan everything and think how the actual hardware will be connected later.![Screenshot_2025-10-19-22-17-20-813_com.android.chrome.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzUwOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e57024b2492987bc68acc6f867f1a2c9dcbc941f/Screenshot_2025-10-19-22-17-20-813_com.android.chrome.jpg)![Screenshot_2025-10-19-22-15-00-787_com.android.chrome.jpg](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzUxMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5489c440c34e44176cd376e1836271d7dcb76a1e/Screenshot_2025-10-19-22-15-00-787_com.android.chrome.jpg)
