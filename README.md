# Smart Plant Watering and Monitoring System

**Hi, I am Gaurav. I am 15 years old and I made this whole project using only my phone because I do not have a laptop. My phone has just 4GB RAM, but I really wanted to learn and make something cool, so I tried my best and completed it.
This project is called the Smart Plant Watering and Monitoring System. It can automatically water plants when the soil becomes dry and also shows temperature and humidity on an LCD screen.**

# How It Works

**The soil moisture sensor checks if the soil is dry.
When it becomes dry, the ESP32 turns on the relay, which starts the water pump.
The pump sends water to the plant through a small pipe.
When the soil becomes wet again, the pump stops automatically.
The DHT11 sensor measures temperature and humidity and displays the data on the LCD screen.
All parts are connected to the ESP32 and placed safely inside a small plastic box to protect them.**

# Components Used

**ESP32 board**

**DHT11 sensor**

**Soil moisture sensor**

**3 water pumps**

**2 relay modules**

**16x2 LCD display**

**Jumper wires and breadboard**

**Type-C cable**

**Plastic box**

**Small pipe**

# Box

**I used a small plastic box to keep the ESP32, relay, LCD, and wires safe from water.
I made small holes for the sensors to go outside and placed the LCD on top so I can easily see the readings.
I tried to make a 3D model in the Prisma 3D app on my phone, but it did not work well, so I made this simple setup using the box instead.**

# About Me

**I am from a middle-class family and my parents cannot afford a laptop right now. Still, I really love electronics and coding, so I am doing all this on my phone.
This project taught me a lot about sensors, coding, and circuits, and I want to keep learning and making more projects like this in the future.**
