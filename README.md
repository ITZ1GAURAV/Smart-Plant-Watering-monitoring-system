# Smart Plant Watering and Monitoring System

**hey im gaurav im 15 yrs old and i made this full project using just my phone cuz i dont have any laptop. my phone has only 4gb ram but still i wanted to learn and make something cool so i did it.
this project is smart plant watering n monitoring system. it can water plants automatic when soil is dry and also show temp n humidity on lcd.**

# how it works

**the soil sensor checks if soil is dry.
if its dry then esp32 turns on relay and water pump starts.
it sends water to plant using small pipe.
when soil gets wet again, pump stops.
dht11 sensor shows temp and humidity on lcd.
all things work with esp32 n small box i used to keep everything safe.**

# components i used

**esp32 board**
**dht11 sensor**
**soil moisture sensor**
**3 water pumps**
**2 relay modules**
**16x2 lcd display**
**jumper wires and breadboard**
**type c cable**
**plastic box**
**small pipe**

# Box 

**i used small plastic box to keep esp32, relay, lcd n wires safe from water.
made small holes for sensors to go outside.
lcd is on top so i can see data easily.
i tried to make 3d model in prisma 3d app on my phone but it didnt work good. so i just used box setup instead.**

# About me

**im from middle class family n my parents cant afford laptop rn. still i really like electronics and coding stuff so i did all this on my phone. i learned a lot from this project and i wanna make more like this.**
